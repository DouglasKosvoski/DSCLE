        "In the Age of Ancients, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog. A land of gray crags, Archtrees and Everlasting Dragons.<br>
        But then there was fire, and with fire came disparity. Heat and cold, life and death, and of course, light and dark.<br>
        Then from the dark, they came, and found the Souls of Lords within the flame.<br>
        Nito, the first of the dead,<br>
        the Witch of Izalith, and her Daughters of Chaos,<br>
        Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and his faithful knights,<br>
        and the furtive pygmy, so easily forgotten."<br>

        <br>
        "With the Strength of Lords, they challenged the Dragons.<br>
        Gwyn's mighty bolts peeled apart their stone scales.<br>
        The Witches weaved great firestorms.<br>
        Nito unleashed a miasma of death and disease.<br>
        And Seath the Scaleless betrayed his own, and the Dragons were no more."<br>

        <br>
        "Thus began the Age of Fire. But soon, the flames will fade, and only Dark will remain.<br>
        Even now, there are only embers, and man sees not light, but only endless nights.<br>
        And amongst the living are seen, carriers of the accursed Darksign."<br>

        <br>
        "Yes, indeed. The Darksign brands the Undead.<br>
        And in this land, the Undead are corralled and led to the north,<br>
        where they are locked away, to await the end of the world.<br>
        ... This is your fate."<br>

    <!-- Overview -->
    <div id="overview" style="text-align: justify">
      <h2 class="subtitle">Overview</h2>
      <p>The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat and cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of Dark, the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath, time, space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people mutating into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First Flame, becoming the fuel for another age. If this is not done, the First Flame will eventually die, and an Age of Dark will begin.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Age of Ancients</h2>
      <p>
        In the beginning, the world was unformed, shrouded by fog; homogeneous. Gray crags, archtrees, and everlasting dragons were the extent of that which existed there. This period was known as the Age of Ancients.
        But then, the Advent of Fire occurred. This created Disparity in the world: with it came heat and cold, life and death, and light and dark. From the dark, came humanoid creatures - Hollows. These creatures found souls near the First Flame, and took on the powers they gave. With the strength of these souls, four figures were born: Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, Gwyn, the Lord of Sunlight, and the Furtive Pygmy. With the powers gained, the Lords overthrew the dragons, ushering in the Age of Fire.

      <h2 class="subtitle">Age of Fire</h2>
      <p>
        With the dragons defeated, the Lords took over the world. It was a prosperous era, and from it many nations were born. The land which the lords hailed from, Lordran, became the center of many adventures for those of other nations to engage in. The First Flame became linked to the bonfires throughout Lordran, and gave power to them. In time however, the Flame began to fade.
        <br><br>Desperate to ensure that their Age of Fire continued, and afraid of the coming Dark, Gwyn did everything to keep the flame lit. They linked the bonfires to humanity, and shepherded the humans to kindle the flames. In contrast, the Witch of Izalith attempted to use her soul to create a new flame, but this did not work, instead birthing the Bed of Chaos and, by extension, the creation of Chaos and Demons.
        <br><br>Aware that time was quickly running out for his kingdom, Gwyn and a detachment of his knights entered the Kiln of the First Flame. Gwyn had them stand guard while he entered the room which contained the First Flame. Gwyn then sacrificed himself to the Flame, turning the Kiln to ash, and incinerating all of his knights, creating the Black Knights and dooming them to wander the lands as disembodied spirits forever after.
        <br><br>The start of Dark Souls takes place some time after all of this has occurred, and the Flame is quickly fading. Soon, only Dark will remain.
        <br><br>In Dark Souls III, many Lords of Cinder had come and passed and the Age of Fire had persevered. However, when the new chosen Lord, Prince Lothric, refused to link the fire, a desperate attempt to save the fading Flame began. Four Lords of Cinder were resurrected to link the fire once more, however - aside from Ludleth of Courland - they too chose to abandon their duties, forcing the Ashen One to drag them back.
